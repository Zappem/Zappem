					<em>Better than the rest</em>
					Bug trackers like <strong>Rollbar</strong> and <strong>Honeybadger</strong> are expensive and have a short data retention policy.

					<em>It's free!</em>
					<strong>maggot</strong>.io is free because it runs on your own database. Store as much as you can for as long as you like!
				</p>

					<em>More secure</em>
					Your exceptions could contain confidential information. Keep them safe by storing all your data on your own server.
